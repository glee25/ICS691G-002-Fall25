# Itâ€™s About Time: An Empirical Study of Date and Time Bugs in Open-Source Python Software
  * Conference: *IEEE*
  * This study analyzed 151 real-world date/time bugs from open-source Python projects on GitHub to categorize where and why these issues occur. The findings show that time zone handling and incorrect construction of date/time values are the most common sources of errors, often caused by misconceptions about library APIs. Most bugs were small, localized, and easy to fix, suggesting that static analysis and automated testing could effectively detect and prevent such high-impact issues.
